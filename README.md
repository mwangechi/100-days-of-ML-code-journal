# 100-days-of-ML-code-journal
I am taking up the challenge to to Learn Machine Learning at least an hour everyday.


## Day 0 : June 3rd , 2019
**Today's Progress** : I have created a schedule & identified what I want to achieve after the 100 days. Selected projects to do as well. It going to be an serious learning journey and am ready for take off. 

**Thoughts** : Hoping to learn Machine Learning and build on my portfolio.

## Day 1 : Jun 4th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I read on Feature Engineering .

**Thoughts** : Learnt of how to create new features from existing features in the dataset to improve my model's performance.

**Link of Work:**  Here is a write up on it  


## Day 2 : Jun 5 th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I read on Feature Importance .

**Thoughts** : Learnt how pickig the right features helps improve one model

**Link of Work:** Here is a write up on it    


## Day 3 : Jun 5 th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I read on hyperparameters .

**Thoughts** : I got to understand the various methods used in choosing the optimal hyperparameters for

## Day 4 : Jun 6 th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I went for a meetup Nairobi Metta for the first ever Kaggle day in Nairobi.

**Thoughts** : learnt of what one can get from the Kaggle platform, not just a competition site, but there much more...

**Work:** Here is what I got from the session: Kaggle: an online community of data scientists and machine learners, owned by Google which offers: Machine learning competitions - which its is best known for. Companies post problems and the participants compete to build the best algorithms to solve the challenge. From this you can build on your portfolio and also win some good money.It has a cloud-based workbench (Kaggle Kernels) that allows data scientist to code and share their code snippets (kernels) in R and Python. And when your laptop/PC can’t handle some large datasets this can be a good option.Community members share datasets from different domains.It has a Jobs board where employers post ML jobs. AI tutorials - It’s a really good playing field to learn and improve your #datascience skills


## Day 5 & Day 6: Jun 8 & 9th ,2019

**Today's Progress** : I picked one dataset from Kaggle and worked on it.

**Thoughts** : Hands on try on an actual dataset from Kaggle and something on evaluation matrix

**Link of Work:**  See code attached and a write up of what else I did learn in the process.


## Day 7 : Jun 10th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : Regression, Linear, Multiple and Logistic regression

**Thoughts** : learnt of what one can get from the Kaggle platform, not just a competition site, but there much more...

## Day 8 : Jun 12th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : Classification algorithms

**Thoughts** : Covered Decision Trees,KNN

**Link of Work:** 

## Day 9 : Jun 13th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : Classification algorithms

**Thoughts** : Covered SVM and did a mini-project incorporating the 4 classiers and did comparision of how the models performed.

## Day 10 : Jun 15th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : Ensemble methods

**Thoughts** : Covered SVM and did a mini-project incorporating the 4 classiers and did comparision of how the models performed.
