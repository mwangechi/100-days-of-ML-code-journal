# 100-days-of-ML-code-journal
A journal of my progress and what I achieve on my 100 days of ML code challenge.

## Day 0 : June 3rd , 2019
**Today's Progress** : I have created a schedule & identified what I want to achieve after the 100 days. Selected projects to do as well. It going to be an serious learning journey and am ready for take off. 

**Thoughts** : Hoping to learn Machine Learning and build on my portfolio.

## Day 1 : Jun 4th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I read on Feature Engineering .

**Thoughts** : Learnt of how to create new features from existing features in the dataset to improve my model's performance.

**Link of Work:**  Here is a write up on it  


## Day 2 : Jun 5 th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I read on Feature Importance .

**Thoughts** : Learnt how pickig the right features helps improve one model

**Link of Work:** Here is a write up on it    


## Day 3 : Jun 5 th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I read on hyperparameters .

**Thoughts** : I got to understand the various methods used in choosing the optimal hyperparameters for

## Day 4 : Jun 6 th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I went for a meetup Nairobi Metta for the first ever Kaggle day in Nairobi.

**Thoughts** : learnt of what one can get from the Kaggle platform, not just a competition site, but there much more...

**Link of Work:**  See attached write up on it


## Day 5 & Day 6: Jun 8 & 9th ,2019

**Today's Progress** : I picked one dataset from Kaggle and worked on it.

**Thoughts** : Hands on try on an actual dataset from Kaggle and something on evaluation matrix

**Link of Work:**  See code attached and a write up of what else I did learn in the process.


## Day 7 : Jun 10th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : Regression, Linear, Multiple and Logistic regression

**Thoughts** : learnt of what one can get from the Kaggle platform, not just a competition site, but there much more...

## Day 9 : Jun 13th , 2019

**Today's Progress** : Classification algorithms

**Thoughts** : Covered SVM and did a mini-project incorporating the 4 classiers and did comparision of how the models performed.
